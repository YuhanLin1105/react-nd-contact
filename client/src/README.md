### Why React

*Declarative vs impertive Code
using .map(), .reduce(), .filter() in JavaScript to write your code in a declarative way.  

Imperative code instructs JavaScript on how it should perform each step. With declarative code, we tell JavaScript what we want to be done, and let JavaScript take care of performing the steps.

React is declarative because we write the code that we want, and React is in charge of taking our declared code and performing all of the JavaScript/DOM steps to get us to our desired result.
